    <p>- As a kid, I would say I was pretty much a typical or normal kid who loves to play. The only unique trait I had was probably being the laughing stock of everyone as I was too easy to be picked on to. I'm just glad I didn't turn out the way I think I would being pushed by people like that.</p>

    <p> - The first few months pf the pandemic was probably the phase of my life where I felt like I had so much time but less freedom not because of the pandemic or quarantine but because I was trapped by my own misery or should I say trapped myself in it.</p>

    <p> - A year after the pandemic is when I started realizing my value and purpose in life. This was also the time I started recognizing and acknowledging myself as an artist. I've work on many portraits every night. Slowly seeing my progress made me love that concept.</p>
